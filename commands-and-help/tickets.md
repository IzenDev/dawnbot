## Wisdom Ticket System

**Information related to Wisdom's Ticketing System**

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Ticket Commands are only usable by Discord Server users with Staff Permissions!**
{% endhint %}

***

## Commands

* `ticketsetup` - Sends the Ticket Embed Message so that users are able to open Tickets.
* `ticket-add` - Adds the mentioned user to the current Ticket
* `ticket-remove` - Removes the mentioned user from the current Ticket.
* `requeststaff-enable` - Enables users to request for Staff in their Ticket
* `requeststaff-disable` - Stops users from bothering staff by not allowing them to request them.&#x20;

## Staff Panel

> Wisdom has a Staff Panel within its Ticketing System that allows staff to manage tickets. Staff members can manage the Ticket with behind-the-scenes as all of the messages will be hidden from the view of other members. Currently, the only features are to **Delete** the Ticket and view the **Ticket Logs**.&#x20;

***

## Request Staff

> Requesting staff is another feature of Wisdom's Ticketing system. If enabled, the ticket's creator will be able to call for staff if they have been waiting a while with no response. User's can only use this button every 30 minutes to stop spam. **(The 30 minute rule is PER TICKET)**.&#x20;

***

## Close Ticket

> Users have the option to close their own Ticket if they would like. This will immidently remove the permissions for the Ticket Creator to speak in their Ticket. This is just in case the user accidentally opens a Ticket or is waiting for staff to delete it.

**If you run into any issues while using the Ticket System, make sure to report them.** [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Nm6VqHuPnu)
