## PRIVACY POLICY

The most common reason your data may be collected is so that our bot, @Wisdom#5373, runs correctly on your server/guild.

Just by adding Wisdom to a server, it will automatically store the Guild ID (Server ID) in its database. By saving the Guild ID, the bot can send messages, set variables for the server, and allow for Server-Side data.

Running any utility command that configures the bot to run differently from its stock form will save its required ID `(User ID/Message ID/Role ID/Channel ID)`. This is for remembering what roles have been added, and messages sent, and to managing the right roles.

This data is never stored for longer than the bot is in your server. It will stay saved in our database until you remove it from your server.

You do have the right to opt out of data collection. If you would like to opt out, then **DO NOT** add Wisdom to your server. This is the only way to opt out.

If you would like to request early removal of your data, we are able to reset it for your server. Please make a support Ticket in our Discord server and describe to us what you would like done.
