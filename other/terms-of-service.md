## TERMS

* "Wisdom" will refer to the main Wisdom bot or any "sister bots."

### CONDITIONS

> The terms of service for Wisdom apply to every user using Wisdom, and for every server that the bot is currently in.

> The terms of service are subject to change at any moment. You will receive a notice above the new change but it is your responsibility to check them.

> By adding Wisdom to your server and using it or using its commands, you automatically agree to these Terms.

### TERMS OF USE

Any intentional disruption, including but not limited to spanning commands, inputs, or other forms of Interactions to try and crash/lag Wisdom is strictly prohibited.

You may not use Wisdom to attempt to "backdoor", hack, or raid any one user's account, server, or other application.

Users may not use open-source code in order to reproduce their own bot and/or application. Wisdom's code is open source for your security, not to be stolen.

Wisdom, a Wisdom Developer, or Bot Admin reserves the right to prohibit any use of Wisdom under any circumstances. We can restrict your access to Wisdom as we wish.

We, the team at Wisdom, are not responsible for any violation of Discord Terms. You, the client, will take full responsibility.

If any Wisdom Developer, Administrator, or User discovers the use of Wisdom for malicious practices, they reserve the right to report you directly to Discord Trust and Safety.

Trying/attempting to gain access to Wisdom, its Bot Token, or its owner's account is strictly not allowed by anyone and you will be reported to Discord.

Users of Wisdom are not allowed to use any exploit, bug, or weakness in code/security to do anything against the Terms of Service. Including both these terms and Discord's.

_By using Wisdom, you automatically agree to these terms._
