# ðŸš  Fun (or Useless)

{% hint style="success" %}
**Fun commands can be used by everyone without any special permissions!**
{% endhint %}

On top of having a bunch a little utility features, Wisdom has some fun features that are pretty much useless. If you are bored mess around with these. (Most of these commands have been suggested by Iz, my beta-tester.)

***

* `8ball` - Gives you a random answer to a Yes or No question. Like a Magic 8 Ball
* `random` - Gives you a random number between `1-10000`
* `code` - Gives you a random code with 1-10 characters.
* `cookies` - Cookies.
* `milk` - Milk
* `crazy` - Rats make me crazy
* `gyatt` - Iz command. Ask him what it does.
